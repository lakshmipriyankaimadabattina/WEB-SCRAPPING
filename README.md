<p> WHAT IS WEB SCRAPPING ? </p>
<p> Web scraping is an automatic method to obtain large amounts of data from websites. Most of this data is unstructured data in an HTML format which is then converted into structured data in a spreadsheet or a database so that it can be used in various applications. </p>
<p> WORK I DONE IN THIS POST </p>
<p> In this post I have scrapped swiggy website using python using two python libraries Beautifulsoup and requests respectively. </p>
